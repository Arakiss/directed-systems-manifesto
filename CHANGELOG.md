## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Structure

Document reorganized into four parts:
- Part I: What We Know (research synthesis)
- Part II: What We Propose (framework as proposal)
- Part III: What We Do Not Know (uncertainty)
- Part IV: Practical Implications

### Added

- Sheridan & Verplank (1978) as anchor for "directed" terminology
- Bainbridge blockquote with proper citation
- Elish (2019) "moral crumple zone" reference
- Explicit uncertainty acknowledgments

### Removed

- Invented terminology: "Taskifier," "Operational Framework," "Three Powers"
- Unsupported predictions
- Claims of vocabulary ownership

### Changed

- Five roles presented as "lenses for analysis," not discoveries
- Clear separation between research synthesis and proposed framework
- Plain language throughout

### Standard

Would this survive review by Bainbridge or Hinton? The previous version would not. This version might.

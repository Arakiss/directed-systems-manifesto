> On Human-AI Collaboration in the Age of Autonomous Agents

A document structured in four parts:

1. **What We Know**: 70 years of automation research
2. **What We Propose**: A framework for thinking about directed configurations
3. **What We Do Not Know**: Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty
4. **Practical Implications**: For individuals, organizations, and researchers

## Key Concepts

**Levels of Automation** (Sheridan & Verplank, 1978): "Directed" refers to configurations where AI holds significant decision-making authority while humans retain execution and oversight.

**Ironies of Automation** (Bainbridge, 1983): The monitoring problem, skill decay, difficulty transfer, and designer error. Unsolved after 40 years.

**Substitution Myth** (Dekker & Woods, 2002): The false belief that machines can replace human tasks without transforming work.

## What This Is Not

This document does not claim discovery. The proposed framework should be evaluated on usefulness, not treated as established fact.

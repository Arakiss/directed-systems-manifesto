> The inversion of cognitive hierarchy: AI agents direct, humans execute.

**Directed Systems** is a framework for understanding the emerging model of work where AI agents process information and make decisions, while humans provide what agents cannot: physical presence, legal identity, and social trust.

## Core Thesis

For centuries, the structure of work has been clear: humans think, tools execute.

That era is over.

What comes now is the formalization of something already happening: **the complete inversion of cognitive hierarchy**.

## Key Concepts

- **The Five Components**: Directing Agent, Operational Framework, Taskifier, Operator, Feedback Loop
- **The Three Powers**: Power of Framework (architect), Power of Execution (operator), Power of Feedback (teacher)
- **The Transition Window**: The temporary configuration where agents can decide but humans are still necessary to execute

## Emerging Roles

- **Directed Operators** — Professionals who receive instructions from agents, execute with judgment, and provide feedback
- **Framework Architects** — People who define the rules and boundaries under which agents operate
- **Exception Debuggers** — Those who resolve what the agent cannot, where value concentrates
